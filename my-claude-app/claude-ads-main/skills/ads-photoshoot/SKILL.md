# Ads Photoshoot — AI Product Photography

Transforms a product image or description into professional ad-ready photography
in 5 distinct visual styles. Each style generates at two sizes: 1:1 (Meta/LinkedIn)
and 9:16 (TikTok/Reels/Stories).

## Quick Reference

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ads photoshoot` | Interactive: ask for product + styles |
| `/ads photoshoot --styles studio floating` | Generate only selected styles |
| `/ads photoshoot --product shoe.jpg` | Start with a product image file |
| `/ads photoshoot --all-platforms` | Generate all 5 sizes per style |

## Environment Setup

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-key"
# See /ads generate for alternative providers
```

## Process

### Step 1: Collect Product Information

Ask (combine into one message):
1. **Product image**: Path to product image file (local) OR product URL OR text description
   > "Provide a product image path (e.g. ./product.jpg), a URL, or describe your product"
2. **Product description**: What is it? Key features to highlight? (helps prompt quality)
3. **Styles to generate**: Which of the 5 styles? (default: all 5)
   - Studio, Floating, Ingredient, In Use, Lifestyle
4. **Target platforms**: Which platforms will these run on?
   - Determines output sizes (default: Meta + TikTok → 1:1 + 9:16)

### Step 2: Load Brand Profile (Optional)

Check for `brand-profile.json` in the current directory.

If found, extract for style injection:
- `colors.primary` → inject into backgrounds and accent elements
- `aesthetic.mood_keywords` → inject as atmosphere descriptors
- `target_audience` → use for Lifestyle and In Use context
- `imagery.forbidden` → exclude from all prompts

If not found, proceed with standard style templates.

### Step 3: Check API Key

Verify the required environment variable is set before generating:

```bash
python3 -c "
import os, sys
provider = os.environ.get('ADS_IMAGE_PROVIDER', 'gemini')
keys = {'gemini': 'GOOGLE_API_KEY', 'openai': 'OPENAI_API_KEY',
        'stability': 'STABILITY_API_KEY', 'replicate': 'REPLICATE_API_TOKEN'}
env_var = keys.get(provider, 'GOOGLE_API_KEY')
if not os.environ.get(env_var):
    print(f'Error: {env_var} not set (provider: {provider})', file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(1)
print(f'OK: {env_var} is set')
"
```

If this exits with code 1, show setup instructions from
`~/.claude/skills/ads/references/image-providers.md` and stop.

### Step 4: Construct Prompts per Style

For each selected style, build the prompt using the template + product description + brand DNA.

#### Style 1: Studio
Clean, e-commerce style product shot.

**Base template:**
```
"[product description], professional product photography, clean white seamless
background, even studio lighting, soft drop shadow, high detail product focus,
ecommerce style, [brand.colors.primary] subtle accent reflections if applicable,
top-down or 3/4 angle, no distractions, catalog quality"
```

**Composition:** Centered, slight 3/4 angle or flat lay.
**Output sizes:** 1080×1080, 1080×1920

#### Style 2: Floating
Dramatic levitation effect.

**Base template:**
```
"[product description] floating in mid-air, dramatic floating product shot,
[brand.colors.primary or brand.aesthetic.mood_keywords[0]] gradient background,
atmospheric shadow below product, levitation effect, product defying gravity,
clean modern aesthetic, high contrast, striking visual"
```

**Composition:** Product centered vertically, ample space above and below.
**Output sizes:** 1080×1080, 1080×1920

#### Style 3: Ingredient
Flat lay with components.

**Base template:**
```
"[product description] centered flat lay, surrounded by its key ingredients
or materials artfully arranged, top-down overhead view, clean light background,
natural texture surface, product as hero element, ingredients scattered with
intentional negative space, editorial food photography style"
```

**Composition:** Top-down, product in center, ingredients fanning out.
**Output sizes:** 1080×1080 (optimal for this style)

#### Style 4: In Use
Authentic usage context.

**Base template:**
```
"person's hands using [product description] in natural context, lifestyle
photography, focus on product-hand interaction, shallow depth of field,
warm natural window light, authentic not staged, [brand.target_audience.profession]
implied context, [brand.aesthetic.mood_keywords] atmosphere"
```

**Composition:** Hands prominent, product clearly identifiable, background soft-focus.
**Note:** Hands only — no full face (avoids model release complications).
**Output sizes:** 1080×1080, 1080×1920

#### Style 5: Lifestyle
Aspirational full-context shot.

**Base template:**
```
"[product description] in aspirational lifestyle scene, [brand.target_audience.age_range]
demographic implied environment, [brand.target_audience.profession] context,
[brand.aesthetic.mood_keywords] atmosphere, golden hour or clean natural lighting,
editorial photography style, [brand.aesthetic.negative_space] composition,
product clearly visible and prominent"
```

**Composition:** Environmental context, product as hero element within the scene.
**Output sizes:** 1080×1080, 1080×1920

### Step 5: Generate Images

For each style × size combination:
```bash
python ~/.claude/skills/ads/scripts/generate_image.py \
  "[constructed prompt]" \
  --size [WxH] \
  --output ./product-photos/[style]/[product-slug]-[style]-[WxH].png \
  --json
```

Track results. If a generation fails, retry once with a simplified prompt.

### Step 6: Organize and Report

**Output directory structure:**
```
./product-photos/
  studio/
    product-studio-1080x1080.png
    product-studio-1080x1920.png
  floating/
    product-floating-1080x1080.png
    product-floating-1080x1920.png
  ingredient/
    product-ingredient-1080x1080.png
  in-use/
    product-in-use-1080x1080.png
    product-in-use-1080x1920.png
  lifestyle/
    product-lifestyle-1080x1080.png
    product-lifestyle-1080x1920.png
```

**Summary:**
```
✓ Product photos generated: [N] images

  Studio:     ./product-photos/studio/ (2 sizes)
  Floating:   ./product-photos/floating/ (2 sizes)
  Ingredient: ./product-photos/ingredient/ (1 size — square only)
  In Use:     ./product-photos/in-use/ (2 sizes)
  Lifestyle:  ./product-photos/lifestyle/ (2 sizes)

  Estimated cost: [N] images × $0.067 = ~$[total]

  Best for:
  • Meta Feed → Studio (4:5) or Lifestyle (4:5)
  • TikTok/Reels → Floating (9:16) or In Use (9:16)
  • LinkedIn → Studio (1:1) or Lifestyle (1:1)
  • Google PMax → Studio (1:1) — crop to 1.91:1 after

  Run `/ads generate` to use these in a full campaign.
```

## Cost Estimate

Before generating, show:
- Number of styles selected × 2 sizes = total images
- "$[N] images × $0.067 = ~$[total] (Gemini default)"
- If >$0.50, ask for confirmation

## Platform Recommendations

| Style | Best Platforms | Rationale |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| Studio | Meta Feed, LinkedIn, Google PMax | Universal, clean, platform-safe |
| Floating | Meta Reels, TikTok, Stories | High visual impact on vertical placements |
| Ingredient | Meta Feed, Pinterest | Works best as square; tells product story |
| In Use | TikTok, Meta Reels, Stories | Authentic, native-feeling content |
| Lifestyle | All platforms | Aspirational, broad audience appeal |
