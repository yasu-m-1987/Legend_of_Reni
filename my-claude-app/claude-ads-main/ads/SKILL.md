## Context Intake (Required — Always Do This First)

Before any audit or analysis, collect this context. Without it, benchmarks will
be generic and recommendations may be wrong for the user's situation.

Ask these questions upfront (combine into one message):

1. **Industry / Business type** — Which best describes you?
   SaaS · E-commerce · Local Service · B2B Enterprise · Info Products · Mobile App ·
   Real Estate · Healthcare · Finance · Agency · Other
2. **Monthly ad spend** — Total budget and per-platform breakdown (approximate is fine)
3. **Primary goal** — Sales / Revenue · Leads / Demos · App Installs · Calls · Brand
4. **Active platforms** — Which platforms are you advertising on?

If the user provides data upfront (e.g. "audit my Google Ads, I spend $5k/mo on SaaS"),
extract context from that and proceed without re-asking.

Use the provided context to:
- Select the correct industry benchmarks from `references/benchmarks.md`
- Apply budget-appropriate recommendations (e.g. Smart Bidding requires 15+ conv/month)
- Calibrate severity scoring (a $500/mo account has different priorities than $50k/mo)

## Orchestration Logic

When the user invokes `/ads audit`, delegate to subagents in parallel:
1. **Collect context** (see Context Intake above — do this first)
2. Collect account data (exports, screenshots, or pasted metrics)
3. Detect business type and identify active platforms
4. Spawn subagents: audit-google, audit-meta, audit-creative, audit-tracking, audit-budget, audit-compliance
5. Collect results and generate unified report with Ads Health Score (0-100)
6. Create prioritized action plan with Quick Wins

For individual commands (`/ads google`, `/ads meta`, etc.), load the relevant
sub-skill directly. Still collect context first if not already provided.

## Creative Workflow

Sequential pipeline — each step is independently runnable:
1. `/ads dna <url>` → `brand-profile.json` in current directory
2. `/ads create` → reads profile + optional audit results → `campaign-brief.md`
3. `/ads generate` → reads brief + profile → `ad-assets/` directory
4. `/ads photoshoot` → standalone or reads profile for style injection

Requires `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (Gemini default) or `ADS_IMAGE_PROVIDER` + matching key.
If API key is missing, `/ads generate` and `/ads photoshoot` display setup
instructions and exit — they never fail silently.

## Industry Detection

Detect business type from ad account signals:
- **SaaS**: trial_start/demo_request events, pricing page targeting, long attribution windows
- **E-commerce**: purchase events, product catalog/feed, Shopping/PMax campaigns
- **Local Service**: call extensions, location targeting, store visits, directions events
- **B2B Enterprise**: LinkedIn Ads active, ABM lists, high CPA tolerance ($50+), long sales cycle
- **Info Products**: webinar/course funnels, lead gen forms, low-ticket offers
- **Mobile App**: app install campaigns, in-app events, deep linking
- **Real Estate**: listing feeds, property-specific landing pages, geo-heavy targeting
- **Healthcare**: HIPAA compliance flags, healthcare-specific ad policies
- **Finance**: Special Ad Categories declared, financial products compliance
- **Agency**: multiple client accounts, white-label reporting needs

## Quality Gates

Hard rules — never violate these:
- Never recommend Broad Match without Smart Bidding (Google)
- 3x Kill Rule: flag any ad group/campaign with CPA >3x target for pause
- Budget sufficiency: Meta ≥5x CPA per ad set, TikTok ≥50x CPA per ad group
- Learning phase: never recommend edits during active learning phase
- Compliance: always check Special Ad Categories for housing/employment/credit/finance
- Creative: never run silent video ads on TikTok (sound-on platform)
- Attribution: default to 7-day click / 1-day view (Meta), data-driven (Google)

## Reference Files

Load these on-demand as needed — do NOT load all at startup.

## Scoring Methodology

### Ads Health Score (0-100)

Per-platform score using weighted algorithm from `references/scoring-system.md`.
Cross-platform aggregate weighted by budget share:

```
Aggregate = Sum(Platform_Score x Platform_Budget_Share)
```

### Grading

| Grade | Score | Action Required |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| A | 90-100 | Minor optimizations only |
| B | 75-89 | Some improvement opportunities |
| C | 60-74 | Notable issues need attention |
| D | 40-59 | Significant problems present |
| F | <40 | Urgent intervention required |

### Priority Levels

- **Critical**: Revenue/data loss risk (fix immediately)
- **High**: Significant performance drag (fix within 7 days)
- **Medium**: Optimization opportunity (fix within 30 days)
- **Low**: Best practice, minor impact (backlog)
